# AutoQEC

Code for the paper [Automated Discovery of Autonomous Quantum Error Correction Schemes](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.3.020302). Examples here correspond to bosonic code discovery with Hamiltonian distances 1 and 2.

Notice that the Julia codes were written for older Julia versions, such as v0.7.
